After choosing the period of study, I decided to write a small one for training, to make and use the maximum number of new technologies for me

among which:

1. useState and useEffect hooks. With the useState hook, I implemented the translation of the page into another language and a live search for lessons. The useEffect hook allowed me to process the api request easily.

2. Receiving data via api, and further data processing, so with this method I implemented the loading state while the request is being processed (I used "mockapi.io" for this)

3. Component approach and routing with react-router-dom.

4. Live search, using "filter includes"

5. Tests, on topics that we get from the conditional database, the code itself reads how many questions are in this topic, and how many of them you answered correctly

6. Storing data on local storage, adding it there and retrieving it

7. Several interesting elements in the layout, such as a gradient, card rotation animation, and a beautiful search

8 Modal window with a small registration opening and some animation on the site

In the end, I want to say that I am very pleased with this project, it allowed me to strengthen my knowledge, and allowed me to experiment with new technologies.
